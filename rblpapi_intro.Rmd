# Third Time Lucky: The Rblpapi package

The new rewrite is different:

. . .

> - Lighter -- no longer uses or requires Java
> - Simpler -- leverages [Rcpp](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.html)
> - More flexible -- easy to add new functionality with C++


# Status: The Rblpapi package

Where we are at now:

. . .

> - Robust and fast
> - Implements most widely-used features
> - (Basic) documentation for everything
> - Travis CI integration
> - On [GitHub](https://github.com/armstrtw/Rblpapi) and in the [ghrr](http://ghrr.github.io/drat) repository


# Examples

Core Functions known from other API accessors:

. . .

\scriptsize

> + `bdp(c("ESA Index", "SPY US Equity"), c("PX_LAST", "VOLUME"))`
> + `bds("GOOG US Equity", "TOP_20_HOLDERS_PUBLIC_FILINGS")`
> + `bdh("SPY US Equity", c("PX_LAST", "VOLUME"), start.date=Sys.Date()-31)`
> + `getBars("ESA Index", startTime=ISOdatetime(2015,1,1,0,0,0))`
> + `getTicks("ESA Index", "TRADE", Sys.time()-60*60))`
> + `fieldSearch("VWAP")`


# Current Status of the Rblpapi package

Things we addressed

. . .

> - Fixed-dimension retrieval very easy
> - Now include shared library with \texttt{rpath}-encoded path
> - Build "everywhere" including on Travis CI


# Current Status of the Rblpapi package

Things we need to address:

. . .

> - DataFrame class caused trouble, need something new
> - Builds on ``that other OS'' very difficult while (vendor) API library built with VC++ 
> - More features: subscriptions, screens, portfolios...
>     - Pull requests welcome!


# Summary: The Rblpapi package

Concluding:

. . .

> + Bloomberg provides a first-rate API and infrastructure 
> + So the R Community came up with good packages
> + Language/OS choice matter: some vendors still "different"
> + We prefer Open Source; package may not go on CRAN as is
> + But we have alternatives in [GitHub-hosted repositories](http://ghrr.github.io/drat)
